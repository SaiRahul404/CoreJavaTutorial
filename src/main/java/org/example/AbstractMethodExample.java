// If any class is having at least one abstract method the such class is called Abstract class
// You cannot create an object of an abstract class.
// Reason : Because Vehicle is incomplete (it has a missing move() method).
//  Subclasses which extends the abstract class should override the abstract methods(complusory)
// Abstract classes provide a common base but are incomplete without subclasses.
// You cannot create objects of abstract classes directly.
